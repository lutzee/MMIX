Lutzee's TAOCP project repository
=================================

In this repository I will be storing and compiling everything I do as I work through reading Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.
I do not expect to complete every task in the book series, but I will make a decent attempt to complete as much as possible.

This is both a learning excercise and something to keep me busy, especially while I have free time arround university.

I am open to any questions, queries, and input on the work presented here.
